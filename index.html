        <p>
            Cats have been domesticated for thousands of years.
            The earliest evidence of domesticated cats dates back to ancient Egypt,
            where they were revered as sacred animals. Cats were also kept as pets
            in ancient Greece and Rome, and they were brought to Europe by the
            Romans. In the Middle Ages, cats were associated with witchcraft and
            were often persecuted. However, they eventually became popular pets
            in Europe and were brought to the Americas by European settlers. Today,
            cats are one of the most popular pets in the world and are kept by millions
            of people in every country.
