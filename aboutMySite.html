                This website has been a journey of discovery for me. I have learnt so much about the intricacies of
                website design, the importance of user experience, and the significance of accessibility. I have
                discovered the power of CSS and JavaScript in creating dynamic and interactive web pages. I have also
                come to appreciate the importance of responsive design and the need for websites to be accessible to all
                users, regardless of their device or disability.
            </p>
            <p class="text-content">
                I have also learnt about the importance of content and how it can make or break a website. I have
                discovered the power of images and videos in engaging users and conveying information. I have also
                learnt about the importance of SEO and how it can help drive traffic to a website. I have discovered the
                power of social media in promoting a website and engaging with users.

                Looking back, there are definitely things that I would have done differently if I had realised them
                earlier. For example, I would have paid more attention picture size and quality, as well as the overall
                layout of the website. I would have also spent more time on the content and made sure that it was clear,
                concise, and engaging.
